## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ngbk1993/guitar_tab.git
cd your-repo-name
```

### 2. Add Your Songs
Place your chord files (.txt) inside the songs/ folder. Each file should have chords in square brackets:

[C]Let it [G]be, let it [Am]be, let it [F]be

### 3. Generate the Search Index
```bash
python generate_index.py
```
This will create (or update) songs.json, which is used for searching.


### 4. Preview Locally
Run a local server:

```bash
python -m http.server
```
Then open your browser and visit:
http://localhost:8000

### 5. Contributing Songs
You’re welcome to contribute new chord/lyric files!

a) How to Submit a Song:
Fork this repository

b) Create a new .txt file in the songs/ folder

c) Use square brackets for chords (e.g., [Am]I see a [F]sky full of [C]stars)

d) Use a clear filename (e.g., coldplay_sky_full_of_stars.txt)

e) Run the Python script to update songs.json (optional, the maintainer can do this too)

f) Commit and push your changes
